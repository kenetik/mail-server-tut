{"name":"Mail-server-tut","tagline":"Setup Free Mail Server Tutorial","body":"Free Perfect Email Server - Detailed Tutorial\r\n===========================================\r\nThis tutorial covers all the details steps for creating your own custom email server using a Virtual Private Server running Ubuntu 12.10 x64 with iRedMail 0.8.4, iRedAdmin, PostgreSQL, Roundcubemail, Awstats, Apache and SSL Certificates.\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n- - -\r\n_I used [Digital Ocean SSD VPS](http://url.phsrvr.com/T1rqd) for this tutorial. (Included in this tutorial is a coupon for 2 months of free service.)_ \r\n\r\nIf you already have a perfectly configured server, you can skip to: 'Install iRedMail'.\r\n- - -\r\n[README.md on GitHub](https://github.com/kenetik/mail-server-tut/blob/master/README.md) \r\n###Create a Droplet (aka VPS)\r\n####I highly recommend using [Digital Ocean SSD VPS](http://url.phsrvr.com/T1rqd) for this setup. If you are creating a new account, use the coupon `SSDPOWER` for 2 months of free service.\r\nAfter creating a new account, click `Create Droplet`  \r\n    * [Screen Shot of Creating a Droplet via Digial Ocean](http://grab.by/n7w6)\r\n\r\n1. Assign hostname (for this tutorial I will be using mail.yourdomain.com)\r\nFrom my tests 2GB/2CPUS/40GBSSD configuration works the best, but for trial and error we will use the smallest configuration.\r\n[Screen Shot of Assigning Hostname](http://grab.by/n7wa)\r\n\r\n2. Select Region - _This is based on your location, or potenial users location._ I chose San Francisco \r\n    * Select Image - _We will be using Ubuntu 12.10 x64 for this tutorial._ \r\n        + [Screen Shot of Selecting Image and Location](http://grab.by/n7wE)\r\n    * Click Create Droplet - You will be greeted with a message about your droplet being created. (Wait approximately 60 seconds, usual much less.) You will be automatically redirected to your droplet upon it's creation. Check your email for the root password.\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Create Button](http://grab.by/n7wK)\r\n        + [Screenshot of Droplet After Creation](http://grab.by/n7wU)\r\n3. Change your server's password\r\n    * Login to your server using a SSH Client (PuTTY/Terminal/Digital Ocean's Console Access) with the details given from the email. In your SSH Client type the following command:\r\n        + ```\r\n          ssh root@yourip\r\n          ```\r\n    * You will be prompted about a RSA key fingerprint. Type 'yes' as the prompt. \r\n        + ```\r\n          yes\r\n          ```\r\n        + [Screenshot of RSA Prompt](http://grab.by/n7xw) \r\n  * Enter the random password generated during droplet creation. You should now be logged into your server and see something similar to this: \r\n        + [Screenshot of Successful Server Login](http://grab.by/n7xI) \r\n    * __It is very important__ to now change the password to something secure of your choice. At the command prompt type the following command: \r\n        + ```\r\n          passwd\r\n          ```\r\n        + [Screenshot of Password Change](http://grab.by/n7xM)\r\n4. Reboot your server by typing the following command:\r\n\r\nNow your in! Let's start configuring!\r\n- - -\r\n###Setup 2GB of Swap Memory\r\n_This helps with server stability and is optional but __highly recommended__._\r\n\r\n1. Login back into your server and type the following command:\r\n    * ```\r\n\t  dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=2097152\r\n\t  mkswap /swap && chown root. /swap && chmod 0600 /swap && swapon /swap\r\n\t  echo /swap swap swap defaults 0 0 >> /etc/fstab\r\n\t  echo vm.swappiness = 0 >> /etc/sysctl.conf && sysctl -p\r\n\t  ```\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Command](http://grab.by/n7yI)\r\n2. Check to make sure your swap file is active by typing the following command:\r\n    * ```\r\n\t  free -m\r\n      ```\r\n      will show Swap: 2047\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Swap: 2047 Displayed](http://grab.by/n7yO)\r\n\r\nSwap (virtual ram) is setup!\r\n- - -\r\n###Set your domain's DNS via Digital Ocean's Control Panel\r\n_Please ensure that your domain's dns are forwarding to your server if you are not using Digital Ocean_\r\n\r\n1. Add a domain to your account by visiting [Digital Ocean's Domain Control Panel](https://www.digitalocean.com/domains) | [Screen Shot of DCP](http://grab.by/n7z2)\r\n\t1. Click the [Add Domain] button\r\n\t2. Input your domain, droplet's ip address, and select your droplet.\r\n\t    + [Screen Shot of Domain Inout](http://grab.by/n7z8)\r\n\t3. Click the [Create Domain] button. You should see 'Domain was successfully created'.\r\n\t4. Click the [Add Record] button\r\n        * Select MX as the Record Type\r\n\t\t* In Hostname input:\r\n            + `mail.yourdomain.com.` _Ensure the trailing `.` after your domain._\r\n        * In Priority\r\n        * You also want to add a CNAME record for 'mail', '@'. _This may seem a little redundant, but it ensures SSL Certification ease later._\r\n            + `10`\r\n        * Click the [CREATE] button\r\n\t\t \t+ [Screen Shot of Domain Information Input](http://grab.by/n7IM)\r\n\r\nDNS is set!\r\n- - -\r\n###Ensure VPS is Updated\r\n_Again, if this is a pre-configured VPS and you now everything is good to go, you may skip this step, but is still recommended_\r\n\r\n1. From your SSH Client use the following command:\r\n    * `apt-get update`\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Update Results](http://grab.by/n7zG)\r\n        + and then this command\r\n    * `apt-get upgrade`\r\n        + Depending on how many items need to be updated, you will see something similar to the following screenshot and be prompted to continue. Type `Y`, and your server will begin updating.\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Update Process](http://grab.by/n7zO)     \r\n\r\nYour up to date!\r\n- - -\r\n###Set your Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)\r\n_If its already set, it would be a good idea to confirm it_\r\n\r\n1. Edit the hosts file by typing the following command:\r\n    * `nano /etc/hosts`\r\n        + [Screen Shot of the Hosts file via Nano](http://grab.by/n7A2)\r\n2. Change the default line to:\r\n    * `127.0.0.1 mail.yourdomain.com mail localhost`\r\n    * _You can verify this by rebooting, and typing:_\r\n        + `hostname -f`\r\n\r\nYour FDQN is now set!\r\n- - -\r\n###Install iRedMail\r\n_This is the magic software and step for all users_\r\n\r\n1. From the command prompt type the following command:\r\n    * ```cd /tmp\r\n        wget https://bitbucket.org/zhb/iredmail/downloads/iRedMail-0.8.4.tar.bz2\r\n        tar jxvf iRedMail-0.8.4.tar.bz2\r\n        rm iRedMail-0.8.4.tar.bz2\r\n        mv iRedMail-0.8.4 iRedMail\r\n        cd iRedMail\r\n        bash iRedMail.sh```\r\n    * Your server will begin installing requirements. \r\n2.

Feel accomplished yet?\r\n- - -\r\n###Create a Secure SSL Certificate\r\n_For tutorial purposes we will use [InstantSLL](http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/free-ssl-certificate.html) for a free certificate_\r\n\r\n1. Create a Certificate Signing Request by typing the following command:\r\n    * ```\r\n\t   cd /etc/ssl\r\n\t   openssl req -out mail.yourdomain.com.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mail.yourdomain.com.key\r\n      ```\r\n\t* You will be prompted for information about your certificate, fill them out as requested. The 'extra' attributes are not required (Do not give a challenge password)\r\n\t    + [Screen Shot of Certificate Information](http://grab.by/n7DA)\r\n2. Open your Certificate Signing Request by typing the following command:\r\n\t* `nano mail.yourdomain.com.csr`  \r\n        + [Screen Shot of CSR Results](http://grab.by/n7DQ) _I have removed some information and replaced it with *'s for security purposes_\r\n3.

Then click 'Next >'\r\n    * [Screen Shot of CSR Box @ InstantSSL](http://grab.by/n7E4)\r\n\t* After [InstantSLL](http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/free-ssl-certificate.html) validates your request (more steps) you will receive a .zip containing two files. [ mail_yourdomain_com.ca-bundle and mail_yourdomain_com.crt] ([Screen Shot of the files](http://grab.by/n7GQ)) _To rush the validation, you can log into the comodo account you created and download the .zip of certificate files from your account panel._\r\n4. Place both of these files in /etc/ssl on your server\r\n\t* After unzipping the document, open each file with your favorite text editor.\r\n\t* Copy and paste the information in each file into the same file name on your server.\r\n5. Modify Apache's default-ssl to reflect these SSL Certificates\r\n    * Type the following command `nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl`\r\n\t* Replace the default information so that the following is set\r\n\r\n                SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/mail_yourdomain_com.crt\r\n        \t    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/mail.yourdomain.com.key\r\n        \t    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/mail_yourdomain_com.ca-bundle\r\n    \r\n    * _Please ensure to remove the `#` before SSLCACertificateFile and do not place the `>>` in the file, as these are indicators for your benefit_\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Default-SSL Configuration](http://grab.by/n7HC)\r\n\t\t+ Use `Ctrl+X` and `Y + Enter` to save the adjustments\r\n\r\n6. Modify Postfix and Dovecot's configuration files\r\n    * Postfix: `nano /etc/postfix/main.cf`\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Postfix main.cf](http://grab.by/n8Gw)\r\n        + Under #TLS Parameters change: \r\n    \r\n                smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/mail_yourdomain_com.crt \r\n                and \r\n                smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/mail.yourdomain.com.key  \r\n\r\n\t* Dovecot: `nano /etc/postfix/main.cf`\r\n        + [Screen Shot of Dovecot main.cf](http://grab.by/n8GQ)\r\n\t\t+ Under # SSL: Global settings change: \r\n\r\n                ssl = required \r\n                verbose_ssl = yes \r\n                (this is optional, but added for debug help) and, \r\n                ssl_cert = </etc/ssl/mail_yourdomain_com.crt \r\n                ssl_key = </etc/ssl/mail.yourdomain.com.key  \r\n        \r\n        + Use `Ctrl+X` and `Y + Enter` to save the adjustments\r\n\r\n7. Reboot by issuing the command `reboot`\r\n\t* [Screen Shot of Reboot](http://grab.by/n8GW)\r\n    \r\n8. Verify your SSL is working by visiting https://mail.yourdomain.com\r\n_Depending on which browser/OS you are using, you will see a lock icon next to your URL similar to the screenshot_\t[Screen Shot of SSL Secured Page](http://grab.by/n7J4)\r\n\r\nYou have your very own SSL Secured Address!\r\n- - -\r\n###Configure iRedAdmin Accounts\r\n\r\n1.
